Query 1:
This query will join candidates from the first dataset to candidates from the second dataset to find how many votes that candidate received

We need to tranform the second dataset, namely we need to create primary keys to link the second dataset to the first dataset.

Query 2:
For candidates who ran multiple elections, return the amount contributed to that candidate and the amount of votes that canidate received.
We will need to use aggregations on amounts and joins.

We need to ensure that there are no duplicates in the primary keys for Election_ID

Query 3:
Determine which house district generated the most votes, and the total contributions that district received.
We will need joins and aggregations, grouping by district and year

We will need the same transformation as the first query
