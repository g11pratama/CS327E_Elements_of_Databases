In the "Contributes" table, we tried to cast TRANSACTION_DT as type date. However, GCP returns an error when we try to do it. It shows "Invalid cast from INT64 to DATE at [2:104]", which means we are not able to cast TRANSACTION_DT as type date because the values in that column do not have the date type format. Therefore, we can only leave the type as integer. 

In the "Candidates" and "Committees" tables, some of the zip code are nine digits. We need to trim down those zip codes to five digits so they are consistent throughout the entire table.

In the second datasets, we need to transform the "runs" table. First, we will reform the “candidate” column in the table so that it has the same format as the “name” in the “Candidate” table from our first dataset. Then we will use the “Candidate” table to link the Candidate name in the "runs" table with the Candidate Label. Next, we will replace the Candidate name with the Candidate Label. Now, the Candidate Label links the "runs" table with the “Candidate” table. Finally, we will combine the Candidate Label and the Election ID to create a Primary Key for the "runs" table.
