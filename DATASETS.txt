Dataset 1
Description:

The main dataset is about political campaign contribution made from 2007-2018. It contains two different data types and each has seven data files for the following years: 2007-2008, 2009-2010, 2011-2012, 2013-014, 2015-2016, 2017-2018 and 2019-2020. The first data type lists each contribution or independent expenditure made by a political action committee, party committee, candidate committee or other federal committee to a candidate during the two-year election cycle. The second data type contains one record for each committee registered with the Federal Election Commission. 
While the first data type lists contributions and expenditures made by committees, the committees are denoted by FEC filer identification number. The second data type is a master of the committees registered with the FEC, so the first data type is linked by the committee identification number to the second data type, which will have the I.D. number, as well as names and addresses for the committees. 

By analyzing this dataset, we are going to find out the major donors of the political campaigns during the past 14 years. This dataset will provide us some insights about which area or states have the highest donation, indicating a high public interest in politics. Moreover, through measuring the time series of these contributions, we can find out whether the public is more or less interested in politics. If the public are more involved in politics, the contribution will increase as time goes by. Further insights we hope to gain on is the flow of these committee contributions and whether there are shifts of contributions to different political parties.

Dataset 2

Description:

The second dataset is about nationwide political election results from 1976 to 2018. There are three data files inside this dataset: election results of U.S. senate, election results of U.S. president and election results od U.S. house of representatives. These three files all have similar structures. Each of them contains the following information:

1.	The year of election
2.	The state of election
3.	The district number in each state of election
4.	The type of election (house, senate or president)
5.	The stage of election (general or primary)
6.	Whether it is a runoff election
7.	Whether it is a special election
8.	The candidate’s name
9.	The number of votes that a candidate receives in a certain state district
10.	The total number of votes in that state district

Using the above information, we first union all three files into one file and divide the above information into two entity types: “runs for” and “election”. From our first dataset, we have already established a candidate table with candidate name, state, office and etc. For each entity in “election” table, it has an election_id (primary key), election year, election state, election district, election type, and total number of the votes in that election district. For each entity in the “runs for” table, it links the candidate_id with the election_id. It also contains the number of votes that a candidate receives in that election. One candidate can only attend one election per year and one election can have multiple candidates.

By adding this secondary dataset, we intend to find out the relationship between political contribution and election results. In other words, we are trying to find out that whether candidates who received higher amounts of donations tend to have better chances in winning the elections. We are also trying to find out whether the candidates’ party affiliation (republican or democratic) affects their election results and the amount of donations received.
